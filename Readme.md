# Node.js Style Guide

This is a guide for writing consistent and aesthetically pleasing node.js code.
It is inspired by what is popular within the community, and flavored with some
personal opinions.

## 2 Spaces for indention

Use 2 spaces for indenting your code and swear an oath to never mix tabs and
spaces in your code - a special kind of hell is awaiting you otherwise.

## No trailing whitespace

Just like you brush your teeth after every meal, you clean up any trailing
whitespace in your JS files before committing. Otherwise the rotten smell of
careless neglect will eventually drive away contributors and/or co-workers.

## Use Semicolons

According to [scientific research][hnsemicolons], the usage of semicolons is
a core values of our community. Consider the points of [the opposition][], but
be a traditionalist when it comes to abusing error correction mechanisms for
cheap syntactic pleasures.

## Line length

Limit your lines to 80 characters. Yes, screens have gotten much bigger over the
last few years, but your brain has not. Use the additional room for split screen,
your editor supports that, right?

## Quotes

Use single quotes, unless you are writing JSON.

*Right:*

```js
var foo = 'bar';
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var foo = "bar";
```

## Braces

Your opening braces go on the same line as the statement.

*Right:*

```js
if (true) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
if (true)
{
  console.log('losing');
}
```

Also, notice the use of whitespace before and after the condition statement.

## Declare one variable per var statement

Declare one variable per var statement, it makes it easier to re-order the
lines. Ignore [Crockford][crockfordconvention] on this, and put those
declarations wherever they make sense.

*Right:*

```js
var keys   = ['foo', 'bar'];
var values = [23, 42];

var object = {};
while (items.length) {
  var key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var keys = ['foo', 'bar'],
    values = [23, 42],
    object = {},
    key;

while (items.length) {
  key = keys.pop();
  object[key] = values.pop();
}
```

## Use lowerCamelCase for variables, properties and function names

Variables, properties and function names should use `lowerCamelCase`.  They
should also be descriptive. Single character variables and uncommon
abbreviations should generally be avoided.

*Right:*

```js
var adminUser = db.query('SELECT * FROM users ...');
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var admin_user = db.query('SELECT * FROM users ...');
```

## Use UpperCamelCase for class names

Class names should be capitalized using `UpperCamelCase`.

*Right:*

```js
function BankAccount() {
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
function bank_Account() {
}
```

## Constants

Constants should be declared as regular variables or static class properties,
using all uppercase letters.

Node.js / V8 actually supports mozilla's [const][const] extension, but
unfortunately that cannot be applied to class members, nor is it part of any
ECMA standard.

*Right:*

```js
var SECOND = 1 * 1000;

function File() {
}
File.FULL_PERMISSIONS = 0777;
```

*Wrong:*

```js
const SECOND = 1 * 1000;

function File() {
}
File.fullPermissions = 0777; 
```

## Object / Array creation

Use trailing commas and put *short* declarations on a single line. Only quote
keys when your interpreter complains:

*Right:*

```js
var a = ['hello', 'world'];
var b = {
  good: 'code',
  'is generally': 'pretty',
};
```

*Wrong:*

```js
var a = [
  'hello', 'world'
];
var b = {"good": 'code'
        , is generally: 'pretty'
        };
```

## Equality operator

Programming is not about remembering [stupid rules][comparisonoperators]. Use
the triple equality operator as it will work just as expected.

*Right:*

```js
var a = 0;
if (a === '') {
  console.log('winning');
}

```

*Wrong:*

```js
var a = 0;
if (a == '') {
  console.log('losing');
}
```

## Extending prototypes

Do not extend the prototypes of any objects, especially native ones. There is a
special place in hell waiting for you if you don't obey this rule.

*Right:*

```js
var a = [];
if (!a.length) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
Array.prototype.empty = function() {
  return !this.length;
}

var a = [];
if (a.empty()) {
  console.log('losing');
}
```

## Conditions

Any non-trivial conditions should be assigned to a descriptive variable:

*Right:*

```js
var isAuthorized = (user.isAdmin() || user.isModerator());
if (isAuthorized) {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
if (user.isAdmin() || user.isModerator()) {
  console.log('losing');
}
```

## Function length

Keep your functions short. A good function fits on a slide that the people in
the last row of a big room can comfortably read. So don't count on them having
perfect vision and limit yourself to ~10 lines of code per function.

## Return statements

To avoid deep nesting of if-statements, always return a functions value as early
as possible.

*Right:*

```js
function isPercentage(val) {
  if (val < 0) {
    return false;
  }

  if (val > 100) {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
function isPercentage(val) {
  if (val >= 0) {
    if (val < 100) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Or for this particular example it may also be fine to shorten things even
further:

```js
function isPercentage(val) {
  var isInRange = (val >= 0 && val <= 100);
  return isInRange;
}
```

## Named closures

Feel free to give your closures a name. It shows that you care about them, and
will produce better stack traces:

*Right:*

```js
req.on('end', function onEnd() {
  console.log('winning');
});
```

*Wrong:*

```js
req.on('end', function() {
  console.log('losing');
});
```

## Nested Closures

Use closures, but don't nest them. Otherwise your code will become a mess.

*Right:*

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  client.connect(afterConnect);
}, 1000);

function afterConnect() {
  console.log('winning');
}
```

*Wrong:*

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  client.connect(function() {
    console.log('losing');
  });
}, 1000);
```

## Callbacks

Since node is all about non-blocking I/O, functions generally return their
results using callbacks. The convention used by the node core is to reserve the
first parameter of any callback for an optional error object.

You should use the same approach for your own callbacks.

## Object.freeze, Object.preventExtensions, Object.seal, with, eval

Crazy shit that you will probably never need. Stay away from it.

## Getters and setters

Do not use setters, they cause more problems for people who try to use your
software than they can solve.

Feel free to use getters that are free from [side effects][sideeffect], like
providing a length property for a collection class.

[sideeffect]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)

## EventEmitters

Node.js ships with a simple EventEmitter class that can be included from the
'events' module:

```js
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
```

When creating complex classes, it is common to inherit from this EventEmitter
class to emit events. This is basically a simple implementation of the
[Observer pattern][].

[Observer pattern]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern

However, I strongly recommend that you never listen to the events of your own
class from within it. It isn't natural for an object to observe itself. It often
leads to undesirable exposure to implementation details, and makes your code
more difficult to follow.

## Inheritance / Object oriented programming

Inheritance and object oriented programming are subjects by themselves.
If you're interested in following this popular programming model, please read my
[Object oriented programming guide][].
